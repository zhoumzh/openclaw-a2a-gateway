# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Bio-inspired integration wiring** — connect 5 standalone bio-inspired modules into the plugin runtime, making them activatable via config (Phase 2.5):
  - Hill equation affinity routing: `routing.affinity` config enables scored multi-dimensional matching instead of first-match
  - Quorum-sensing discovery: `discovery.quorum` config wraps DNS-SD polling with density-aware adaptive intervals
  - Signal decay retry: push notifications now use `sendWithRetry()` with exponential importance decay
  - Adaptive transport: per-peer `TransportStats` tracking with automatic performance-based ordering
  - Michaelis-Menten soft concurrency: `limits.saturation` config adds progressive delay before hard queue limit
- New config schema sections: `routing.affinity`, `discovery.quorum`, `limits.saturation` (all optional, backward-compatible)
- 5-dimension benchmark test suite (`tests/benchmark.test.ts`) comparing legacy vs bio-inspired behavior
- README repositioned with "When to enable" practical guidance for each bio-inspired feature

### Changed

- Push notification delivery upgraded from fire-and-forget `send()` to decay-aware `sendWithRetry()` with default DecayConfig
- Transport fallback loop now records per-peer performance stats for adaptive ordering on subsequent calls
- QueueingAgentExecutor applies Michaelis-Menten delay before task execution when saturation config is present

### Fixed

- `sendWithRetry()` was called without DecayConfig parameter, making signal decay retry effectively dead code — now passes default config (k=0.001, minImportance=0.1, maxRetries=3)
- TransportStats lookup hoisted out of fallback loop to avoid redundant Map.get per iteration

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- Peer skills caching — health check probes extract skills from Agent Card and cache them in `PeerHealthManager`, enabling skills-based routing rule matching (cf3d038)
- mDNS self-advertisement — publish PTR/SRV/TXT records on the local network so other A2A gateways can discover this instance automatically via DNS-SD; responds to queries, re-announces before TTL expiry, sends goodbye packet on shutdown (df98451)
- New config section `advertise` with `enabled`, `serviceName`, and `ttl` options (disabled by default)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- URL-to-FilePart extraction — automatically detects file URLs in agent text responses and converts them to outbound A2A FileParts (PR #35)
- Cross-implementation compatibility test matrix with 20 test cases covering Agent Card, task lifecycle, streaming, and file transfer across SDK versions (PR #36)
- Automatic transport fallback — tries JSON-RPC → REST → gRPC in priority order with error classification and per-peer transport caching (PR #37)
- **P8**: Push notifications for long-running tasks — webhook registration, event delivery with retry, HMAC signature verification, SSRF-safe URL validation (PR #38)
- Rule-based routing engine — route outbound messages by pattern match, tag match, round-robin, and weighted random strategies with priority ordering (PR #39)
- DNS-SD dynamic agent discovery — resolve `_a2a._tcp` SRV/TXT records, auto-register discovered peers, periodic refresh with TTL-based eviction (PR #40)

### Security

- Push notification webhook endpoints protected with bearer auth middleware (PR #38)
- Webhook URL registration validates against SSRF via existing `validateUri` (PR #38)
- Routing rule regex patterns capped at 500 chars, message input truncated at 10K to mitigate ReDoS (PR #39)
- DNS discovery evicts expired peers on refresh failure to prevent stale routing (PR #40)

### Fixed

- SDK `pushNotifications: true` in Agent Card triggered built-in flow conflicts — set to `false` with custom implementation (PR #38)
- `stop()` in DNS discovery now clears `discoveredPeers` map to prevent memory leaks (PR #40)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Ed25519 device identity for OpenClaw ≥2026.3.13 scope compatibility, with auto-fallback for older versions (84f440c)
- Metrics endpoint optional bearer auth via `observability.metricsAuth: "bearer"` (#28)
- CI workflow running TypeScript check + tests on Node 22 and 25

### Fixed

- `auditLogPath` default changed to `~/.openclaw/a2a-audit.jsonl` for cross-platform consistency
- CI switched from `npm ci` to `npm install` to avoid lockfile mismatch failures

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **P0**: Durable on-disk task persistence, concurrency limits (maxConcurrentTasks / maxQueuedTasks), structured JSON logs + telemetry metrics endpoint (PR #14)
- **P1**: Multi-round conversation support with contextId and message history (PR #15)
- **P2**: File transfer — full FilePart (URI + base64) and DataPart support, SSRF protections, MIME allowlist, URI hostname allowlist (PR #12, #13, #16)
- **P3**: Task TTL cleanup with configurable expiration interval (PR #19)
- **P4**: SSE streaming with heartbeat keep-alive for real-time task status updates (PR #21)
- **P5**: Peer resilience — health checks, retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern (PR #22)
- **P6**: Multi-token support for zero-downtime credential rotation (PR #23)
- **P7**: JSONL audit trail logging for all A2A calls and security events (PR #24)
- **P9**: Cross-platform default `tasksDir` path (`~/.openclaw/a2a-tasks`)
- `a2a_send_file` agent tool for programmatic file transfer to peers
- Agent skill at `skill/` for guided A2A setup (installation, peering, TOOLS.md)
- SDK-based CLI message sender (`skill/scripts/a2a-send.mjs`) using `@a2a-js/sdk` ClientFactory
- Async task mode with non-blocking send + polling for long-running prompts
- Per-message routing to specific peer OpenClaw agentId (OpenClaw extension)
- gRPC transport support (server + client)

### Fixed

- Missing `operator.read` / `operator.write` scopes in agent dispatch (PR #2)
- Deterministic session key from A2A contextId for reliable multi-agent routing (PR #3)
- Failed task status now properly returned when agent dispatch fails (PR #6)
- Gateway `connect.challenge` handshake handling
- Config shape unified — `security.fileSecurity` flattened into `security`
- Task cleanup retry logic hardened (PR #20)
- `operator.read/write` scopes restored after accidental loss in P5/P6 refactor

### Changed

- Zero-config install — plugin ships with sensible defaults, no manual configuration required (PR #10)
- Outbound A2A calls refactored to use `@a2a-js/sdk` ClientFactory
- All curl examples replaced with SDK script in documentation
- Shared test helpers extracted to reduce duplication across test files

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- Initial A2A v0.3.0 protocol implementation
- Agent Card endpoint at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`
- JSON-RPC and REST transport endpoints
- Bearer token authentication for inbound requests
- Agent dispatch via OpenClaw Gateway API
- Task lifecycle management (create, get, cancel)
- English and Chinese README
